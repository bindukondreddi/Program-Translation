The String Table

  Create such a table. Define function intern(s) that looks up string s in the table and returns the string stored for s. If s is not in      the table, it should be inserted and the inserted string returned. By using intern, you will only have one copy of each string
  
 Abstract Syntax Trees

  Create a type of abstract syntax trees that describe an expression. (You will use abstract syntax trees both for describing expressions   and for describing values of expressions.)
  
 The Symbol Table

  Create a table whose keys are strings and whose values are trees. Keep it simple. You should be able to ask whether a particular string   is a key in the table,insert a particular string, with a corresponding tree, into the table,look up a string and get the corresponding     tree.
